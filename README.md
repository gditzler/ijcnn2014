# IJCNN 2014 Matlab Scripts

This repo contains some of the scripts required to run the results presented in Ditzler et al.'s IJCNN manuscript. Email <gregory.ditzler@gmail.com> for question about the code or data requests.


# Dependencies
* [Incremental Learning](http://github.com/gditzler/IncrementalLearning) - Add the contents of `IncrementalLearning` to your matlab path. 
* [ConceptDriftData](http://github.com/gditzler/ConceptDriftData) - The SEA, elec2 and noaa weather data can be found in in the `ConceptDriftData`. You will need to create `elec2.mat` and `neweather_rain.mat` then add them to your path.
* Misc.: [chess data](http://sites.google.com/site/zliobaite/resources-1)

# Citing this work
* Gregory Ditzler, Gail Rosen, and Robi Polikar, "Domain adaptation bounds for multiple expert systems under concept drift," in Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2014, accepted.
