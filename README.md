# IJCNN 2014 Matlab Scripts

This software repository contains some of the Matlab scripts that were used to generate the results in the 2014 [IJCNN](http://www.ieee-wcci2014.org) paper by Ditzler et al [1].

# Dependencies
* [Incremental Learning](http://github.com/gditzler/IncrementalLearning) - Add the contents of `IncrementalLearning` to your matlab path. 
* [ConceptDriftData](http://github.com/gditzler/ConceptDriftData) - The `SEA`, `elec2` and `noaa weather` data can be found in in the `ConceptDriftData`. You will need to create `elec2.mat` and `neweather_rain.mat` then add them to your path.
* Misc.: [chess data](http://sites.google.com/site/zliobaite/resources-1)
